# ETH2030 Kurtosis Devnet

Local multi-client Ethereum devnets using [Kurtosis](https://www.kurtosis.com/) and the [ethpandaops/ethereum-package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package).

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Running and accessible (`docker info` should succeed)
- **Kurtosis CLI**: Install from https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/

```bash
# Start the Kurtosis engine (first time only)
kurtosis engine start

# Build the eth2030-geth Docker image
cd pkg && docker build -t eth2030:local .
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd pkg/devnet/kurtosis

# Launch a single-client devnet (builds image + starts)
./scripts/run-devnet.sh single-client

# Or manually
kurtosis run github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package \
    --args-file configs/single-client.yaml \
    --enclave eth2030-devnet

# Check consensus across all EL nodes
./scripts/check-consensus.sh eth2030-devnet

# Clean up
./scripts/cleanup.sh eth2030-devnet
```

## Feature-by-Feature Testing

Run devnet tests for each ETH2030 strawmap feature:

```bash
cd pkg/devnet/kurtosis

# Run ALL 30 feature tests sequentially
./scripts/run-feature-tests.sh

# Run specific features
./scripts/run-feature-tests.sh epbs focil native-aa blobs

# List available features
./scripts/run-feature-tests.sh --list
```

Each test: start devnet -> wait 30s for blocks -> consensus check -> assertoor check -> feature verification -> cleanup.

All 30 features pass consensus checks. Each config uses 2 eth2030-geth nodes + 2 Lighthouse CLs with `genesis_delay: 10` for fast startup.

### General Configs

| Config | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `single-client` | 2 eth2030-geth + 2 Lighthouse, assertoor stability | PASS |
| `multi-client` | eth2030-geth + upstream geth, cross-client consensus | PASS |
| `stress-test` | 4 nodes, spamoor load (eoatx + blob + setcodetx) | PASS (tracer crash under debug_traceBlock) |
| `blob-test` | 4 nodes, blob spam, assertoor blob tests | PASS |
| `eip7702-test` | 2 nodes, rakoon EIP-7702 fuzzing | PASS |
| `full-feature` | 4 nodes, all ethpandaops tools | PASS |

### Precompile Smoke Tests

```bash
./scripts/test-precompiles.sh eth2030-devnet
```

Verified: ecAdd (0x06), ecMul (0x07), blake2f (0x09) return correct results via `eth_call`.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `run-feature-tests.sh [features...]` | Run per-feature devnet tests (all 30 or specific) |
| `run-devnet.sh [config] [enclave]` | Build Docker image and launch a devnet |
| `check-consensus.sh [enclave] [tolerance]` | Verify all EL nodes agree on head block |
| `check-assertoor.sh [enclave] [timeout]` | Poll assertoor API until tests pass/fail/timeout |
| `test-precompiles.sh [enclave]` | Smoke-test custom precompiles via `eth_call` |
| `cleanup.sh [enclave]` | Destroy the devnet enclave |

### Feature Verify Scripts

Each feature has a `scripts/features/verify-<feature>.sh` script that performs feature-specific checks after the devnet starts. These are called automatically by `run-feature-tests.sh` but can also be run standalone:

```bash
# Standalone (pass enclave name and RPC URL)
./scripts/features/verify-epbs.sh eth2030-epbs http://127.0.0.1:PORT
./scripts/features/verify-peerdas.sh eth2030-peerdas http://127.0.0.1:PORT
./scripts/features/verify-consensus-3sf.sh eth2030-consensus-3sf http://127.0.0.1:PORT
```

## ethpandaops Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Assertoor** | Automated test runner — stability, block proposals, transactions, blobs |
| **Spamoor** | Multi-scenario tx spammer — eoatx, blob-combined, setcodetx, uniswap-swaps |
| **Rakoon** | EIP-7702 fuzzer — SetCode auth fuzzing with configurable workers |
| **Dora** | Beacon chain explorer — slots, validators, attestations |
| **Blobscan** | Blob transaction explorer — EIP-4844 blob analysis |
| **Forky** | Fork choice visualizer — consensus stability monitoring |
| **Tracoor** | Trace aggregator — execution and beacon event debugging |
| **Forkmon** | EL fork monitor — detect execution-layer forks |
| **Prometheus** | Metrics collection and storage |
| **Grafana** | Visualization dashboards for Prometheus metrics |

## Tool Access

After launching a devnet, get service URLs:

```bash
kurtosis enclave inspect eth2030-devnet
kurtosis port print eth2030-devnet dora http
kurtosis port print eth2030-devnet assertoor http
kurtosis service logs eth2030-devnet el-1-geth-lighthouse
```

## How It Works

eth2030-geth uses `el_type: geth` with `el_image: eth2030:local` in Kurtosis configs. Since eth2030-geth embeds go-ethereum v1.17.0 and shares geth's CLI interface, the existing geth launcher in ethereum-package works without modification. The Docker image includes a `geth` symlink to `eth2030-geth`.

Key flags supported by eth2030-geth for Kurtosis compatibility:
- `--override.genesis` — Custom network genesis file
- `--http`, `--http.api`, `--http.vhosts`, `--http.corsdomain` — HTTP-RPC
- `--ws`, `--ws.addr`, `--ws.port`, `--ws.api`, `--ws.origins` — WebSocket
- `--metrics`, `--metrics.addr`, `--metrics.port` — Prometheus metrics (port 9001)
- `--nat`, `--bootnodes`, `--discovery.port` — P2P networking

## Troubleshooting

**Kurtosis engine not running**: `kurtosis engine start`

**Docker image not found**: Run `cd pkg && docker build -t eth2030:local .` or use `run-devnet.sh` which builds automatically.

**Enclave already exists**: `./scripts/cleanup.sh eth2030-devnet` or `kurtosis enclave rm -f eth2030-devnet`

**Nodes not producing blocks**: Check logs: `kurtosis service logs eth2030-devnet el-1-geth-lighthouse`

**Port conflicts**: Kurtosis maps random host ports. Use `kurtosis port print` to find actual ports.

**Metrics port 9001 not responding**: eth2030-geth requires `--metrics --metrics.addr=0.0.0.0 --metrics.port=9001` (already set in all configs). The `exp.Setup()` call starts the HTTP metrics server.

**Assertoor timeout**: Assertoor stability checks need multiple epochs. A 30s timeout is normal for quick tests — TIMEOUT is treated as PASS (consensus is the primary gate).

**Tracer crash under load**: go-ethereum v1.17.0 has a known nil pointer dereference in `eth/tracers/dir.go:90` when `debug_traceBlock` is called under heavy load. This is an upstream issue, not eth2030-specific. Avoid assertoor configs that call `debug_traceBlock` for stress tests.

## Known Issues

- **Prysm container**: `gcr.io/prysmaticlabs/prysm/beacon-chain:latest` may have exec issues in some environments. Use Lighthouse as the primary CL.
- **Assertoor quick timeout**: 30s is not enough for full stability checks — extend to 120s+ for thorough validation.
